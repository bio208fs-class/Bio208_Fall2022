# Strings


### String creation

Strings can be created by typing characters (ASCII or unicode) surrounded by either single quotes or double quotes.

```
# These two strings are equivalent (try evaluating s1 == s2)
s1 = "ATGCAAGC"
s2 = 'ATGCAAGC'
```

Being able to use both types of quotes means you can nest quotes in strings:

```
quote = 'She said, "Hello World!"'
```
